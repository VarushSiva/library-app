# Project: Library - JavaScript Course

A simple Library App project built as part of **The Odin Project's JavaScript Course**, demonstrating the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), DOM manipulation, and modular code organization. The app's layout and design were inspired by a design concept image generated by ChatGPT.

## Assignment Instructions

### Initial Setup

1. **Set up your project**:
   - Create a Git repository for your project.
   - Create skeleton HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### Core Features

2. **Store Books**:

   - Create an array to store your book objects.
   - Write a function to add a new book to this array. Your code might look like this:

     ```javascript
     const myLibrary = [];

     function Book(title, author, pages, isRead) {
       this.title = title;
       this.author = author;
       this.pages = pages;
       this.isRead = isRead;
     }

     function addBookToLibrary(book) {
       myLibrary.push(book);
     }
     ```

3. **Display Books**:

   - Write a function to loop through the array and display each book on the page.
   - Use cards or a table to showcase the book details.

4. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Keep the logic for displaying books (UI) separate from the logic for storing data (book array).

### User Interaction

5. **Add New Book**:

   - Create a "New Book" button to open a form for entering book details (author, title, pages, read status).
   - Use `<dialog>` or other methods for displaying the form.
   - Use `event.preventDefault()` to prevent the form from submitting to a server by default.

6. **Remove Book**:

   - Add a button to each book display that allows users to remove it from the library.
   - Use a `data-attribute` to associate DOM elements with the corresponding book objects.

7. **Toggle Read Status**:
   - Add a button to each book display to toggle its read status.
   - Write a function to update the read status of a book in the array.
